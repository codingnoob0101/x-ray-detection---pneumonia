Pneumonia detection from Chest X-ray

Early diagnostic of Pneumonia can improve clinical outcomes and improve patients well being

Objective:

Building machine learning model to predict Pneumonia from Chest X-rays
The dataset is readily available in Kaggle, and can be downloaded through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The workflow will be:

Examine the dataset folders, and examine the class distribution in each folder (train, test, val)
Visualize the sample image in each class
Data preprocessing (resize images to a uniform size, normalize pixel values, data augmentation, handle class imbalance if present)
